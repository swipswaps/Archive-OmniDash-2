The UI said Authenticated.
The credentials panel was green.
Search results appeared instantly.
Charts rendered smoothly.

If you were skimming, you'd assume everything was wired up
correctly.

But something felt off.

While testing the app, | intentionally replaced valid Internet
Archive credentials with obvious junk — placeholder strings that
should have failed immediately. Nothing changed. The app still
reported that credentials were active. No warnings. No errors. Still
green.

That was the first crack.

The reason became obvious once the backend response was
inspected:

ts
// backend credential status

return {
hascredentials: !!creds
