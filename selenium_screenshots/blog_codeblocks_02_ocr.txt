Archive credentials with obvious junk — placeholder strings that
should have failed immediately. Nothing changed. The app still
reported that credentials were active. No warnings. No errors. Still
green.

That was the first crack.

The reason became obvious once the backend response was
inspected:

// backend credential status
return {
hasCredentials: !!creds

Authentication status wasn't authentication at all. It was a Boolean
existence check — not a real API validation.

The frontend simply reflected that value as:
text

Authenticated
